    <h2> Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      <br>I am very glad to fianlly meet you! I am Sanghui(John) Kim.
      I was born and raised in Seoul, South Korea. 
      <br>I am interested in broadway musicals, accounting, and programming(BEGINNERüòÅ).
      <br>My interest has kept on moving.
      However with those different interests, I let my curiosity and imagination drive reality.
      <br>Currently, I just came back to Korea from the United States.
      6 months of study abroad program was like a dream. <br>I have learned a lot, I have made a precious friend, and most of all, I have enjoyed a lot.
      <br>Life is always unpredictable and challenging. So I am more than excited to start a new journey here in South Korea with a new resolution!
